        <h1>Adventurer's League Overview</h1>
        <p>
            This document provide an overview of some key features of Adventurer's League. For full details see the current Adventurer's League Player's Guide.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Adventurer's League?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Adventurer's League is a set of shared campaigns where you can take your character from game to game, even if they are run by different game masters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Players, and GMs, must follow a code of conduct and should be respectful of each other, and play characters that do not disrupt or impinge upon the fun of fellow players.
            </li>
            <li>The most recent version of content (for classes, origins, spells, etc) is used.
                <ul>
                    <li>Core rules are D&D 2024.</li>
                    <li>Almost all official books are allowed; some are campaign specific.</li>
                    <li><b>Homebrew, and most 3rd party content, is not allowed.</b></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How do I create an Adventurer's League character?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Characters use the 2024 creation rules (including custom backgrounds from DMG 2024).
            <li>Characters start at first level.</li>
            <li>Each character is linked to a specific campaign: Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Eberron, Ravenloft, or Critical Role.</li>
            <li><b>Ability scores use the standard array or point buy.</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>e.g. With standard array and custom background ability scores, use the final values 17, 14, 14, 12, 10, 8.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>When levelling up you get fixed hit points (half hit die, rounded up).</b></li>
            <li>At 5th level you may choose a +1 weapon or class item (see the Player's Guide for the exact list).</li>
            <li><b>Characters may not be evil.</b></li>
            <li>
                You must keep a character log to track adventures and rewards.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may rebuild any aspect of your character between games, but keep the same level, campaign, and equipment.
            </li>
            <li>Instead of 1st level, you may instead start at 5th level, to directly play Tier 2.</li>
        </ul>
