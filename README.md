# Dungeons & Dragons Customisable Pre-generated Characters

Customisable pre-generated characters for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition (2024 rules).

Creating a character can be a time consuming process, with dozens of decisions and hundreds of options to choose from.

For a quick start pre-generated characters are available, where all options have already been chosen.

This project fills the gap inbetween, with a set of modular and customisable pre-generated characters, where the player can still have some degree of customisation.

You should be able to start playing within a few minutes of picking your character.

Simply select one Species sheet, one Background sheet, and one Class sheet (spell casters have an extra sheet).

The Species and Background sheets are generally only half a page, so the Background sheet can be folded in half so both of them are visible when inserted into a plastic folder.

On your Class sheet many aspects, such as ability scores, have been pre-selected. Select your Skills, Trinket, and any Features with options.

Pick your Personality and Alignment traits as a guide for how to portray your character. The approach and morality you pick determine your alignment.

Only a limited set of options (even less than the basic rules) are listed, to provide some customisation without overwhelming options. If you are unsure then the choices listed first (in bold) are a good choice.

Pick any options needed on your Species and Background sheets (many don't have any options).
